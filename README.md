# 🕰️ Memento Mori

**A weekly journal mapped onto the canvas of your life.**

Every square represents one week of an 80-year lifespan. Four groups of 1,040 squares each correspond to 20-year blocks. Green squares show weeks you’ve lived. Orange ones are weeks you’ve written about. Gray ones are still ahead.

You can click on any square to write a reflection, a log, a memory — all data is saved locally in your browser using IndexedDB.
